*Steps to run my program*
Note: Before running the code, create a directory path and place the input_mis_data in that path.

1.Run the Code the code run in swagger.

2.Run the endpoint(api/SchoolStudentInfo/GetUserInfo), which has three parameters: directoryPath, inputFilename, and outputFilename. 
#directoryPath - the location of directory path you created.
#inputFilename - name of your json file which is stored in the directory path.
#outputFilename - the name of your output.

Note: The input_mis_data.json must be placed in the created directory path, and when sending inputFilename in the parameter, the name should be the same as the input_mis_data.json you placed, and the name in the parameter should end with ".json".

3.After the run you can view the result in swagger and can also view the output from the path you created.
